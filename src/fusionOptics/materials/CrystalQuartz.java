/** Crystal Quartz / Fused Quartz - The birefringent form of Fused Silica (SiO2) 
 * 
 * There is some confusion out there, over what is 'quartz', 'fused quartz' and 'fused Silica' etc
 * 
 * In general it seems to be that 'fused' means it's a glass, not a crystal and is therefore not
 *   birefringent. 
 * 
 * 
 * It seems mostly just a purity thing but [ http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=4766 ]
 * says this:
 * " This synthetic material, normally referred to as synthetic fused silica, has 
 *    better optical properties and is somewhat more expensive than the other type.
 *    In the UK, terms such as quartz, silica, fused quartz and fused silica tend to
 *    be used interchangeably. In the USA, quartz refers to material melted from 
 *    grains, silica refers to the synthetic material."
 * 
 * The main source for this data is a brochure for someone selling the stuff:
 * 		[ TYDEX J.S.Co, "Synthetic crystal quartz" Commercial Brochure, 
 *           http://www.tydexoptics.com/pdf/Crystal_quartz.pdf ]
 * 	
 * The Verdet constant at 589.3nm seems to be 0.01664 min cm^-1 gauss^-1
 *	 [S.Ramaseshan "Determination Of The Magnetooptic Anomaly Of Some Glasses" 1946]
 *  277.33 deg m^-1 T^-1, 4.84 rad m^-1 T^-1
 *  

	Temperature dependance (in 0 - 400 'C) is pretty small with 
	  |dn/dT| < 1.5e-5 Kelvin^-1 in the wavelength range 500 - 1500nm
	[  T Toyoda 1983
	  "The Temperature Dependence of the Refractive Indices of Fused Silica and Crystal Quartz" ]
	  
	  
	There is also this paper for 'fused silica', which gives a refractive index formula, but only 1  
	   (no extraordinary ray). It does however, give roughly (slightly lower) temperature dependence.
